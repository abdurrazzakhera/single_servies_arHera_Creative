          <strong>Hi</strong> , I am MD. ABDUR RAZZAK . I have just started the
          web development course. Currently focus on completing the with full
          effort so that I can select for special course for another 2 or 3
          month. Will try to prepare myself for intern as the course direction.
          If everything goes well, I will discuss with seniors, which would fit
          for me and continue to develop my skill to that sector. My main goal
          is be a full-Stack developer so that I can work on different market
          place.
