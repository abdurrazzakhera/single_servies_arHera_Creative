        <p>
          Hi, I am Ashikur Rahman. I have just started the web development
          course. Currently focus on completing the with full effort so that I
          can select for special course for another 2 or 3 month. Will try to
          prepare myself for intern as the course direction. If everything goes
          well, I will discuss with seniors, which would fit for me and continue
          to develop my skill to that sector. My main goal is be a competent
          developer so that I can work on different market place.
